# README

* This is a Ruby on Rails app which was developed to get used to the framework and understand the CRUD concept.

* It features a Movie model, controller, and views which allows users to view, add, edit, and delete movies.

* The app also allows users to view, add, edit, and delete theaters where the movies will be played

* Last but not least, the movies and theaters are connected by a ShowTime join which allows movies to be added to theaters, and show what date and time a specific movie will be played.
