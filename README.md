This is a Ruby on Rails app which was developed to get used to the framework and understand the CRUD concept. It features a Movie model, controller, and views which allows users to view, add, edit, and delete movies. The app also features a Theatre Model which allows users to view, add, edit, and delete theaters. The movies and theaters are connected by a ShowTime join which allows movies to be added to theaters, and show what date and time a specific movie will be played. The app also features a Comment model and controller which allows users to add a comment in movies/show. Users can sign up/sign in to the app, and this is achieved by using the Devise Gem. There is also a "Filter by Genre" feature which allows users to filter the movies by a specific genre
